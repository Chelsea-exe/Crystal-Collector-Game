# Crystal-Collector-Game
You will be given a "Number To Match" at the start of the game. 
Each crystal is equal to a different number, click on the 
crystals to have your "Total" equal the "Number To Match".
If your score is more than the random number then you lose the 
game, the game will reset with your total and random number.
With the new game each crystal will be added to reach the new
random number. A little secret, the value of each crystal is hidden 
until you click on it. When a new game starts the value of each crystal will change, GOOD LUCK!
